Automated Late Ticket System
This project aims to modernize and automate the current manual process of issuing late tickets at schools. Today, students must go to the school office, provide their information, and wait for a ticket to be manually filled out before presenting it to their teacher. This process is time-consuming and prone to errors.

The proposed system automates this workflow while maintaining its core logic. Students will register their tardiness at the office through a simple interface, and the system will automatically log the occurrence in the school's database. Teachers will receive a notification or email confirming the late arrival, eliminating the need for physical tickets and minimizing classroom interruptions.

With real-time integration into the schoolâ€™s database, the system enables the administration to easily track and manage lateness and absences, improving oversight and reducing manual workload. This solution enhances efficiency, accuracy, and the overall experience for students, teachers, and school administrators.
